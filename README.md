# Time_Series
Experimenting with different libraries and algorithms 

The code here my own implimentations of approaches I have seen elsewhere and experimented with on anonamyised data that I have access to. My goal here is to understand the differnt approaches to modelling time series in order to better understand how useful these are with imperfect data, that is not optimally selected for demonstration purposes.
